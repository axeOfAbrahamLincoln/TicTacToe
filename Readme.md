Your tic-tac-toe should do the following things:

1. Play a game of tic-tac-toe against the computer (agent)
2. The game will be rendered on the console
3. The game shall allow either you or the computer to start first
4. The computer agent should randomly select a place the "O" marker in an empty cell
5. Your game will ask the user for the row and column by taking an input line comma separated "row,col", e.g the input could be "1,2". If a user enters incorrect row or column (check for missing values, not a number, too high or low, or already taken), it should ask the user to enter another value.
6. Your game should stop when either of the players win
7. Your game should call out a draw!
